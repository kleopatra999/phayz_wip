  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>Welcome to another issue of the Frugalware Linux community’s newsletter,
  which highlights the latest events and activities of the Frugalware Linux
  community.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <p>Here’s a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h4>Package maintainer changes</h4>

  <p>Every Frugalware package has a nominated maintainer, someone who is
  responsible for keeping it current. As people join and leave the team, some
  packages change maintainer. A new team member might particularly like Ruby
  applications and so take over maintainership of Ruby-based packages. Those
  which don't have an active maintainer are considered 'orphaned' but don't
  worry because even orphaned packages are still updated if needed. In recent
  weeks, developers centuri0 and Pingax have taken over maintainership of
  some orphaned packages. Does anyone else want to take a lonely but loving
  package into their home? Anyone?</p>
  	  
  <h4>bgalakazam is making great progress</h4>

  <p>I reported in the previous newsletter issue that Frugalware user
  bgalakazam had begun translating Frugalware's custom applications and wiki
  into Bulgarian. He/she has now contributed a new package - FIXME. It's
  always great to see the work of new contributors and bgalakazam has had a
  great start.</p>

  <h4>GNOME 3 is now available</h4>
  
  <p>As announced on FIMXE by FIXME, GNOME 3 is now available in the 
  Frugalware 'current' repository. This is arguably the most significant 
  GNOME release because it completely changes the way users interact with the
  desktop. Some people are excited about the release and others are worried by
  such a big change. Try it for yourself and see what you think.</p>

  <h4>Mores wallpaper proposal</h4>
  
  <p>We have had a wallpaper submitted for consideration as the default for 
  Frugalware release 1.5 - code-name 'Mores'. The wallpaper was created by 
  Leo, who also created the default wallpaper for release 1.3 (FIXME - 
  check). The wallpaper is still a work in progress but below you can see 
  the base image, to which the logo will be added. Leo has created many
  more than two wallpapers and all of his work can be seen in his
  http://FIXME[online gallery]. Thanks to Leo for submitting this wallpaper 
  and perhaps it will inspire others to submit their own work.</p>

  <h4>How do you know the end of the world has come?</h4>
  
  <p>...Bouleetbil has not made a git commit for more than 5 minutes. 
  Seriously, if you subscribe to the git commit mailing list you will have 
  seen a <strong>lot</strong> of activity from Bouleetbil. He has been
  incredibly busy packaging GNOME 3, including all the test releases, while 
  still maintaining his packages in the current repository. Thanks to him 
  for his hard work and dedication.</p>

  <h4>Move to /tmpfs instead of FIXME</h4>
  
  <p>On FIXME_date Frugalware developer VMiklos announced that he wanted all 
  packages which used FIXME modified so that they used FIXME instead. He 
  started this change for his own packages and asked all other package 
  maintainers to do the same. In only FIMXE days the change for all packages 
  was complete, which goes to show just how quickly the development team can 
  respond when required. "But what is /tmpfs?" I hear you ask. Well...a 
  simple explanation is that it's a file system in which files are stored 
  temporarily. In other words I don't know. :) If you really want to know,
  perhaps do an Internet search or ask in the forums, or IRC channels.</p>

  <div class="postheader">Tips and Tricks</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/terminal.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <h4>Missing dependencies</h4>

  <p>Frugalware's package manager - pacman-g2 - handles dependencies so that 
  if you install package A and it requires packages B and C to work, all 
  three packages are installed. Some applications have optional features and 
  for these, the dependencies system doesn't apply. Take the example of a 
  GStreamer-based media player as an example. If every one of the GStreamer 
  plugins required to support every available audio format was installed, it 
  might require a lot of disk space. Instead the person packaging the 
  application may decide that only the most common audio formats will be
  specified as dependencies. When you try to play an unsupported audio file,
  it simply won't play. If you're in this situation the best tip is to start
  the application in a terminal and try playing or accessing the problem file.
  Hopefully you will get a message like "Plugin X could not be found." in the
  console, in which case you can then find and install the required package.
  If you're not sure just what the message means, or what to do about it,
  ask online via the forums or users' IRC channel.</p>
  

  <h4>Do you have any tips or tricks to share?</h4>

  <p>In creating Pogo, its developer's aim was to create a music player with 
  an easy-to-use interface. It doesn't support tags so your music library 
  must be arranged with artists and albums in their own directories and 
  sub-directories. As  you can see below, there are just two panes: the left 
  which shows the file browser and the right which shows the playlist. At the 
  very top of the window are a search box, playback controls and a preferences 
  button. Preferences include only: </p>

  <div class="postheader">Users' Desktop Screenshots</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/desktop.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <p>This new section of the newsletter features screenshots of users' desktop
  configurations. Whether we use a desktop environment or only a window
  manager, most of us like to tweak the appearance of our desktop until it
  looks just right. With almost endless configuration options it can become an
  obsession. The screenshots which appear in this section are examples of what
  you can achieve. You may not like them all but you may learn about an option
  or application that you didn’t know before. If the creator of the screenshot
  has provided details of the configuration, these are provided below.</p>

  <p>If you would like to submit your own desktop screenshot, please submit it
  the Frugalware forums and I’ll copy it from there.</p>

  <h4>Slown</h4>

  <p>Slown's desktop screenshot was submitted to the Frugalware forums on 2
  September 2010 and features the GNOME desktop environment with the
  following themeing:</p>

  <ul>
	  <li>GTK - Equinox</li>
	  <li>Icons - Faenza</li>
	  <li>Metacity theme - Equinox</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Pingax</h4>

  <p>Pingax's desktop was submitted to the Frugalware forums on February 13, 
  2011 and features the Awesome window manager.</p>

  <h4>FrugalNL</h4>

  <p>FrugalNL is a relative newcomer to Frugalware but has already started 
  making a contribution in the forums, helping others with their questions. 
  He/she has also decided to try GNOME 3 and below are recent screenshots of 
  both GNOME 2 and GNOME 3 desktops.</p>

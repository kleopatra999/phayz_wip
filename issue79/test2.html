  <h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 79</h2>

  <p>…to inform…to educate…to entertain</p>

  <p>&quot;&quot;</p>


  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>Welcome to another issue of the Frugalware Linux community’s newsletter,
  which highlights the latest events and activities of the Frugalware Linux
  community.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>FIXME</li>
  </ul>

  <br />
  <div class="postheader">Events etc
  </div><img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/calendar.png" width="85"
  height="85"><br>

  <p>Here’s a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h4>New contributor - Baste</h4>
  
  <p>Frugalware user Sébastien VINCENT (AKA Baste) - has been making a great
  contribution, providing some patches and FrugalBuilds for new packages.
  The quality of his work has been great and all his contributions have been
  accepted. I wonder if I should write the "New Frugalware developer"
  announcement in advance? :)</p>

  <h4>Frugalware GNOME Shell theme</h4>
  
  <p>Frugalware developers Devil505 and bouleetbil worked together to create 
  a GNOME Shell theme which features the Orta theme and the default 
  wallpaper for Frugalware release 1.5. The result looks great and is 
  certainly different to the rather plain default theme. The Linux news web 
  site LXnews.org <a href="">featured</a> the theme on FIXME_DATE.</p>

  <h4>Thanks for your bug reports</h4>
  
  <p>Thankyou to everyone who reports bugs in the Frugalware Bug Tracker 
  System (BTS). Without these reports we wouldn't know that these problems 
  exist and so not be able to fix them. Even better is the fact that it's 
  not just a few people reporting bugs but different people. It's great to 
  see "new" names appearing because it confirms that Frugalware is useful to 
  so many people. If you find a problem then please report it in the BTS but 
  before doing so, please read <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/docs/stable/bugs.html">Frugalware Bug Reporting 
  HowTo</a>.</p>

  <h4>Newsletter is no longer being translated</h4>
  
  <p>I had been hoping that the translation of the past few newsletter 
  issues into French and Danish might simply have been delayed but it's time
  to be honest. These translations are no longer being done so I have removed
  mention of them from the bottom of the newsletter. Thanks to those who
  provided the translation of past issues and of course if someone starts
  translation I'd be very happy to announce it here.</p>

  <div class="postheader">Tips and Tricks</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/terminal.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <h4>Skeleton files</h4>

  <p>When a new user is created on Linux, the contents of the <pre>/etc/skel 
  </pre> directory are copied to the users' home page. This allows the 
  computer's administrator to specify configuration settings and/or have 
  folders already available when the user first logs on. For anyone who <b>is
  </b> the administrator in their home ( :D ) you might use this option, for
  example, to encourage everyone to store files by type in specific folders:
  Videos, Photos, Downloads for example. To do this you create directories of
  the required names in /etc/skel (as user 'root'). Note that this applies
  <em>only</em> to newly created users, not existing users.</p>


  <h4>System information script</h4>
  
  <p>Some time ago, Frugalware developer Devil505 and Frugalware user Aptano 
  modified a Perl script which presents information about the GUI 
  environment on the console. A great feature of this is that as well as the 
  system information it displays the Frugalware logo in ASCII art. This 
  works well when you combine it with a desktop screenshot because it 
  clearly identifies the distribution. Look at Botchchikii's screenshot in 
  the Users' Desktop Screenshots section below to see an example of the 
  script's output. To get a copy of the script itself, go to <a href= 
  "http://blog.glag.la/article2/capture-decran-sous-frugalware">this</a> 
  page.</p>


  <h4>Do you have any tips or tricks to share?</h4>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to share, <em>please</em> post them on the forums
  or the comments section below.</p>

  <div class="postheader">Focus on Packages</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/package-new.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <h4>Quod Libet</h4>

  <p>I'm sorry to feature another audio player after featuring Pogo in the 
  most recent newsletter but I couldn't help myself. :) Quod Libet is a 
  full-featured audio player developed in Python and uses the GStreamer
  framework. For anyone who is looking for an alternative to players such as
  Banshee, Rhythmbox or Amarok, Quod Libet could be just what you're looking
  for.</p>
  
  <p>Its features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Album art;</li>
    <li>Track ratings;</li>
    <li>Internet radio;</li>
    <li>Numerous plugins including Scrobbling support, Tray Icon, Alarm Clock
    and Lullaby.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Quod Libet makes it very easy to play your music in the way you want. It
  offers many different ways to browse or search your music and assemble a
  playlist. If you need to correct your music's tags you can do this easily on
  either individual files or several files at once. Tag editing even includes
  some common built-in functions including replacing underscores with spaces,
  removing characters which are incompatible with Windows and removing
  non-ASCII characters.</p>
  
  <p>One quite interesting feature is its Tray Icon plugin. Of course most
  audio players provide system tray support so that you can continue listening
  to a playlist without the player's window cluttering your desktop. Quod
  Libet's tray icon is better than most though because, with the mouse
  cursor over the icon, scrolling the mouse's wheel will change volume and
  holding down the Shift key and scrolling the wheel will change track. As
  with other music players, you can also right-click on the icon and get more
  functions.</p>

  <p>Even if you're currently using a music player, try Quod Libet because it
  offers a great range of features while still being very easy to use.</p>

  <div class="postheader">Users' Desktop Screenshots</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/desktop.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <p>This new section of the newsletter features screenshots of users' desktop
  configurations. Whether we use a desktop environment or only a window
  manager, most of us like to tweak the appearance of our desktop until it
  looks just right. With almost endless configuration options it can become an
  obsession. The screenshots which appear in this section are examples of what
  you can achieve. You may not like them all but you may learn about an option
  or application that you didn't know before. If the creator of the screenshot
  has provided details of the configuration, these are provided below.</p>

  <p>If you would like to submit your own desktop screenshot, please submit it
  the Frugalware forums and I'll copy it from there.</p>

  <p><strong>Remember</strong> - According to the normal support arrangements
  for Frugalware, the release of 1.4 ("Nexon") means that no further security
  or bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 1.3 ("Haven") or earlier.</p>

  <p>Here is a list of <a href="/security">security issues</a> which have 
  been discovered and fixed in the 1.4 release since the previous newsletter.

  <h4>Author</h4>

  <p>The Frugalware newsletter is written and edited by Russell Dickenson (AKA
  phayz). Credit for the Frugalware distribution goes to the development
  team.</p>

  <h4>Release</h4>

  <p>To allow time for review and corrections, each newsletter is written ahead

  the few days before its release - e.g. security fixes. To be sure that you’ve
  got the very latest information on these topics, go to the appropriate page
  of the Frugalware web site.</p>
